This is the first homework of P8105\!

# Problem 1

First I create a data frame:

``` r
df_1 <- tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  logical = norm_samp > 0,
  char = c('a','b','c','d','e',
           'f','g','h','i','g'),
  factor = factor(c('l','l','s','m',
                    'm','s','l','s','m','l'))
)
```

Then I take the `mean` of each variable in the data frame:

``` r
mean(df_1$norm_samp)
```

    ## [1] 0.2188708

``` r
mean(df_1$logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(df_1$char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df_1$char): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(df_1$factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df_1$factor): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

According to the outcome above, `mean` function works on **numeric** and
**logical** variables, but doesn’t work on **character** and **factor**
variables.

Next I apply `as.numeric` function to the **logical**,**character** and
**factor** variables:

``` r
as.numeric(df_1$logical)
as.numeric(df_1$char)
as.numeric(df_1$factor)
```

According to the results which are not shown here, **logical** and
**factor** variables can be converted into numeric, while **character**
variable can not. I think that’s because **logical** and **factor**
values are stored as integers rather than characters in computer. In
this way, the reason why `mean` function works on **logical** variable
but not on **character** variable is clear. However, it can’t help to
explain why I can’t get mean of the factor variable by applying `mean`
function.
