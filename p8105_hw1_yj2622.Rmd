This is the first homework of P8105!

# Problem 1

```{r setup,include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

First I create a data frame:

```{r df_create}
df_1 <- tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  logical = norm_samp > 0,
  char = c('a','b','c','d','e',
           'f','g','h','i','g'),
  factor = factor(c('l','l','s','m',
                    'm','s','l','s','m','l'))
)
```

Then I take the `mean` of each variable in the data frame:

```{r df_mean}
mean(df_1$norm_samp)
mean(df_1$logical)
mean(df_1$char)
mean(df_1$factor)
```

According to the outcome above, `mean` function works on **numeric** and **logical** variables, but doesn't work on **character** and **factor** variables.
